# Multiple-Linear-Regression
A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates multivariate linear regression using the diabetes dataset. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn, with a focus on applying core concepts in a real-world medical dataset.

# Multiple Linear Regression – Diabetes Dataset

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of **multiple linear regression** to model relationships between medical predictor variables and disease progression. The project uses the **diabetes dataset**, a standard dataset often used for evaluating regression techniques in machine learning.

Developed as part of **Machine Learning and Data Science**, the lab guides through the full pipeline of:
- Loading real-world data
- Exploring features
- Preprocessing with normalization
- Building a multiple linear regression model using **scikit-learn**
- Evaluating model performance

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: [NCSU Statistics – Diabetes Dataset](http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.tab.txt)
- **Instances**: 442
- **Features**:
  - Age, Sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), Blood Pressure
  - Six blood serum measurements
- **Target Variable**: Disease progression after one year

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Multivariate regression with multiple predictors
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Model evaluation using metrics such as R²
- Real-world application of medical data
